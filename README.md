# Note Taker App

## Description

This is a simple note taking application built to practice using back-end servers with Express.js. With this application, users will be able to write simple notes to save, re-access or delete across devices.

The deployed and functional site can be found here: <https://note-taker-swv.herokuapp.com/>

## Installation

If you would like to inspect the code, begin by forking the repository and downloading to your computer. Make sure that you have node already installed. 
You may need to run 
```npm init``` or ```npm install``` but no other files should be necessary. Run ```npm start``` to create the server locally.

If you would simply like to see the app in action, no installation is needed, just click the following link: <https://note-taker-swv.herokuapp.com/>

## Usage

To use the application, simply type in the title and text of your note/memo and click the save button in the top right corner. If you would like to navigate to a previous note, clicking on the relevant title on the left column will load that note. To write a new note, the pencil button in the top right corner will re-opne the note editor. If you no longer need a note, clicking the trashcan icon next to the relevant title will delete that note. This is permanent so be careful!
